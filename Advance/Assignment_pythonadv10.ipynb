    "__ __getattribute__ __ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. __ __getattr__ __ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by__ __getattribute__ __ , but for this __ __getattribute__ __ and__ __getattr__ __ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found,__ __getattr__ __ returns a default value. So key difference is that__ __getattr__ __ is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class."
