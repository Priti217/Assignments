    "## Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "### Solution:-\n",
    "Regular Expressions, also known as __regex__ or __regexp__, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of __if/else__ statements."
